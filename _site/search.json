    "text": "The price of the resale HDB market has always been on the rise and have seen tremendous growth over the years. With HDB being an integral part of Singaporeans’ life, it would make sense that the affordability of the HDB is extremely important to the everyday Singaporeans. However, with new such as “HDB resale prices accelerate in Jan as million-dollar deals surge by 42%: SRX, 99.co”or “HDB resale prices rise 2.3% in Q4, slowest increase in 2022”. All this news only serve to highlight the importance of resale flat and the ever growing concern that as time passes, HDB will become more and more unaffordable to us."

The data set can be found in the link provided\n\nRail Station:It is commonly believed that the price of the resale flat is closely related to how close the HDB is to our Rail Station, as being close to the rail station means it is more convenient to travel. We would expect that the closer the rail is to the hdb, the higher the value\nHawker Centers:Hawker Centers are where almost all Singaporeans get their food from. It would make sense that we expect that the closer the Flat is to the Hawker Center the more expensive the flat will be.\nPreschool (Childcare/Kindergarten):Childcare center is especially important to parents with young children and we believe that parents are willing to pay more to have one nearby. It would make sense that we expect that the closer the Flat is to the pre-school the more expensive the flat will be.\nMalls:Hawker Centers are where almost all Singaporeans do their favorite pastime . It would make sense that we expect that the closer the Flat is to the Malls the more expensive the flat will be.\nMosquito Hotspots:We found this data set but we are not sure if there is any correlation. We would expect that since Mosquito spreads dengue fever, a high population will make the flat cheaper.\n\nOur Second Goal is to make use of the above factors to predict the value of hdb resale flat for a given area given using geographically weighted regression models.\n\nWith the goals in mind, we hope that we are able to provide an interactive map of the geographical region with the price of the resale HDB and provide an reference value to the buyer on whether the asking price of the HDB is reasonable or not given the factors of the HDB Flat. This we hope will all users to make better decisions when purchasing a resale of HDB."

We are hoping to build something similar to this, but given that our goal is different, there will be some changes in the data shown\nHDB Resale Flat Prices: This website shows the price of the resale HDB Flat of a given area. This only shows the price of transacted HDB Flat and we are making use of data that this app uses to predict the price.\nPredict the Selling Price of HDB Resale Flats: This article by Kok Jim Meng, shows how he manages to predict the prices of HDB Flat information based on the following characteristic\n1 Problem Statement\nThere are multiple factors affecting the selling price of HDB resale flats in Singapore. Therefore, by using linear regression, I am interested in finding out how the selling price of a HDB resale flat changes based on its following characteristics in this mini exercise:\n\nits distance to the Central Business District (CBD)\nits distance to the nearest MRT station\nits flat size\nits floor level\nits remaining years of lease\n\nThe resources for this mini exercise can be found on my GitHub which includes the dataset, and the Python notebook files — data preprocessing, and data processing (including the building of linear regression)."
