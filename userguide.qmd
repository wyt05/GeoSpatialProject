# Getting Started

## Installing the R and R Studio

While there is a link for you to access the Shiny Application, it is recommended that you run to the R application locally, as the Shiny Webpage does not provide enough resources to run all the features of the application. This is especially so if you wish to build your own model.

The instructions to install R and R Studio can be found [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## Installing the proper packages

You can install all the relevant packages that is needed for Shiny App on R Studio. While there are quite a lot of packages to install, [pacman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) should be prioritized to ensure the easy installation of the rest of the packages.

To Install the packages, Go to the tools sections, click on Install Packages. And insert the name pacman to install the correct packages.
